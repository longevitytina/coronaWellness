## Scope

The final objective is to build an app where users can collect solution cards that help with the CoronaVirus isolation problems. Users will be able to browse an index of problems, select the problem, and then view an index of solution cards. Each solution card can be added into the profile, for viewing later. Due to limited time we were working on MVP and will continue working on sprints. View Milestones section for feature builds and updates.
